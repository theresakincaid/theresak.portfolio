# Theresa Kincaid's ePortfolio

## Professional Self-Assessment

## Category One: Software Design and Engineering
  This artifact is a Java application called “SlideShow” and was originally created in the course CS-250. It started as a slideshow with six slides and two navigation buttons, “Previous” and “Next”. The slides show various wellness related locations, each with an image and a brief description.
  I have chosen to include this artifact in my ePortfolio for the software design and engineering category for various reasons. Frist, it showcases my proficiency in utilizing the Java Swing framework to develop a GUI application. By incorporating components such as frames, panels, labels, and buttons, I have demonstrated my ability to create a clean and interactive user interface. This artifact also demonstrates my ability to properly manage resources. The code accesses image resources stored within the project, and being able to work with images is crucial in many software development scenarios. Additionally, the program follows a structured approach with well-defined methods and classes. This demonstrates my ability to organize code logically and modularize functionality. In software development, modularizing functionality is an important aspect of enhancing a code's reusability and scalability, both of which are highly desirable features across various industries.
  To improve the application, I incorporated two additional buttons and implemented a timer. The first button, labeled "Restart," allows the user to go back to the first slide and restart the slideshow from the beginning. The second button, labeled "Pause/Resume," provides the user with the ability to pause and resume the automatic slideshow progression. When the user clicks the button, it pauses the timer and stops the automatic slide transition. Clicking the button again resumes the slideshow. The text for this button dynamically adjusts according to the state of the timer. The timer implementation adds a time interval of 3 seconds between each slide transition, providing a consistent progression through the slides. Together, these improvements create a more interactive and user-friendly experience, offering greater control over the slideshow navigation.
