# Theresa Kincaid's ePortfolio

## Professional Self-Assessment

## Category One: Software Design and Engineering
This artifact is a Java application called “SlideShow” and was originally created in the course CS-250. It started as a slideshow with six slides and two navigation buttons, “Previous” and “Next”. The slides show various wellness related locations, each with an image and a brief description.

I have chosen to include this artifact in my ePortfolio for the software design and engineering category for various reasons. First, it serves as evidence of my accomplishment of the course outcome, "Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science”. This code is valuable because it provides a visually appealing and interactive way for users to explore different wellness destinations. It accomplishes industry-specific goals related to creating engaging presentations and displaying information to users. The modular design of the code, the naming conventions, and the event-driven architecture all align with industry best practices. Additionally, the program follows a structured approach with well-defined methods and classes. This demonstrates my ability to organize code logically and modularize functionality.

To improve the application, I incorporated two additional buttons and implemented a timer. The first button, labeled “Restart,” allows the user to go back to the first slide and restart the slideshow from the beginning. The second button, labeled “Pause/Resume,” provides the user with the ability to pause and resume the automatic slideshow progression. When the user clicks the button, it pauses the timer and stops the automatic slide transition. Clicking the button again resumes the slideshow. The text for this button dynamically adjusts according to the state of the timer. The timer implementation adds a time interval of 3 seconds between each slide transition, providing a consistent progression through the slides. Together, these improvements create a more interactive and user-friendly experience, offering greater control over the slideshow navigation.

Overall, my experience with making these changes to the artifact was quite smooth. I think the most challenging part of the enhancement was implementing the timer. While understanding the logic of the timer was easy, ensuring that the timer coordinated effectively with the card layout and slide transitions took more time. Nevertheless, I am glad I was able to implement a timer because now the slideshow successfully runs automatically.
