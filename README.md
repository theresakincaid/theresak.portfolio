# Theresa Kincaid's ePortfolio

## Professional Self-Assessment

## Category One: Software Design and Engineering
  This artifact is a Java application called “SlideShow” and was originally created in the course CS-250. It started as a slideshow with six slides and two navigation buttons, “Previous” and “Next”. The slides show various wellness related locations, each with an image and a brief description.
  I have chosen to include this artifact in my ePortfolio for the software design and engineering category for various reasons. Frist, it showcases my proficiency in utilizing the Java Swing framework to develop a GUI application. By incorporating components such as frames, panels, labels, and buttons, I have demonstrated my ability to create a clean and interactive user interface. This artifact also demonstrates my ability to properly manage resources. The code accesses image resources stored within the project, and being able to work with images is crucial in many software development scenarios. Additionally, the program follows a structured approach with well-defined methods and classes. This demonstrates my ability to organize code logically and modularize functionality. In software development, modularizing functionality is an important aspect of enhancing a code's reusability and scalability, both of which are highly desirable features across various industries.

## Category Two: Algorithm and Data Structures

## Category Three: Database
